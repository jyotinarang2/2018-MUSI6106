        "\n",
        "You might remember that earlier; we mentioned subword tokenization as a <i>necessity</i> rather than just a nice-to-have component for ASR. In the previous tutorial, we used the [Connectionist Temporal Classification](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/icml_2006.pdf) loss function to train the model, but this loss function has a few limitations-\n",
        "\n",
        " - **Generated tokens are conditionally independent of each other**. In other words - the probability of character \"l\" being predicted after \"hel##\" is conditionally independent of the previous token - so any other token can also be predicted unless the model has future information!\n",

To accurately tokenize such large volumes of text with minimal vocabulary size, the subwords that are learned inherently model the interdependency between tokens of that language to some degree.\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking at the previous example, the token `hel##` is a single token that represents the relationship `h` => `e` => `l`. When the model predicts the single token `hel##`, it implicitly predicts this relationship - even though the subsequent token can be either `l` (for `hell`) or `##lo` (for `hello`) and is predicted independently of the previous token!\n",
